      <h1>Discovery log</h1>
        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Keep a log of what you do</h3>
            <p>For this task I created a google doc in which I’m going to record anything that I do or learn during any of the tasks set in the practicals.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: Start working with your VM</h3>
            <p>	To complete this task I first went to: http://port.ac.uk/myvm and started the virtual machine for the first time, changed the default password. Once the VM configuration was finished I connected again and experimented with running a Web server with a simple web page.</p>
            <h3>Task 2: Get the Coursework</h3>
            <p>For this task I read the WebF1 Coursework document and saved it in my drive.</p>
            <h3>Task 3: Website Awards</h3>
            <p>After finding someone to work with we discussed and completed the Website Awards document linked in the worksheet.</p>
            <h3>Task 4: Choose an Editor</h3>
            <p>As I don’t have much experience with web design I went with Atom, but as soon as I get more time and experience I will try out some of the other text editors such as Brackets or Sublime Text.</p>
            <h3>Task 5: Further Reading</h3>
            <p>As recommended I read the opening chapter of the book provided.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Web Security:</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Keep a log of what you do</h3>
            <p>	As started last week I’m using this document to keep track of everything I do.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: Work Collaboratively</h3>
            <p>	We created a document called “WebF1 Security Policy Task” and shared it with those within the group.</p>
            <h3>Task 2: Identify all information</h3>
            <p>	Initially we started adding different kinds of generated information, but once we had multiple existing entries we started to consider whether those new entries we proposed were already contained in the previous ones or whether the ones already in the list could be contained in that new entry. After all of this we came across 26 different kinds of information that we generate on a daily basis.</p>
            <h3>Task 3: Categorise that information</h3>
            <p>	Once completed the previous exercise we proceeded with categorising those different kinds of generated information into 3 categories, “secret”, “sensitive” and “public”, and after some discussion we had: 4 out of 26 under “secret” which nobody should have access to, 20 out of 26 under “sensitive” to which only trusted people should have access, and finally 2 out of 26 under “public” which anybody could have access.</p>
            <h3>Task 4: Processing information</h3>
            <p>	On this final task we discussed different approaches to how future social media services could integrate those information security categories and how to approach them, suggesting things such as biometrics and encryption.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: How to begin</h3>
            <p>	First I started thinking of keywords and possible topics for my research, also used the template provided to structure the different resources. Also, as suggested, I started a mind map to keep track of the different directions that different papers take.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: Research</h3>
            <p>	Using the library website I started looking for papers on the literature review subject, and in conjunction with the template I keep a record of those papers that looked like they could be related to mitigating personal exposure online for a more in depth evaluation. I also stopped using the online mind map since I found it easier to write the ideas on a piece to later categorise them.</p>
            <h3>Task 2: Iterate</h3>
            <p>	As the instruction say I iterated through the sources I gathered, discarding some of them in the process since they turned out to be irrelevant to the topic. Also in the process I got a chance to highlight those paragraphs that contained the main ideas and also group those ideas shared across the different papers.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Better Writing</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 1 - 8: Modifying sentences to improve writing</h3>
            <p>	I iterated through the exercises choosing and modifying the sentences as I found adequate in the context of what was asked.</p>
            <h3>Task 9: Practice</h3>
            <p>	As I find myself confident on my writing, since I’m always re-reading and thinking how to improve what I wrote I skipped this exercise.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Create a Web Page</h3>
            <p>	During this practicals task I made my very first html document with the simplest layout possible. Also learned that if we want our server to load a page by default we it needs to be called index.html.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: Upload your web page to your Virtual Machine</h3>
            <p>	After starting the VM I opened WinSCP, a program that uses secure transfer protocols in order to upload/modify files to a remote machine, in this case my VM. After establishing a connection I made a folder in the VM called me and uploaded the index.html file that i had just made.</p>
            <h3>Task 2: Start your web server</h3>
            <p>	As the VM is already started due to the previous task I launched a connection, logged in and moved to the “me” folder that I just made. Once in the folder I run the web server with the “http-server” command. As this was my first time using the web server I accidentally stopped the server by trying to copy the IP addresses that were given (since I didn’t read the next set of instructions) and pressing “crl^c”, the hotkey used to stop the web server.</p>
            <h3>Task 3: Create and upload your own web page</h3>
            <p>	As stated I made a helloworld.html document with very few content and nonexistent styling. Once made I uploaded it and viewed it.</p>
            <h3>Task 4: Further work</h3>
            <p>	As part of my coursework I started looking online for possible approaches and inspecting different web pages that I came across in order to gain more knowledge.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Style</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Preparation</h3>
            <p>	To prepare for this task I made a folder called style in which I placed a file called example.html whose contents are quite simple.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: An Embedded Stylesheet</h3>
            <p>	After making a copy of example.html and renaming  it to embedded.html I proceeded to write some styling for the document within the document using a &lt;style&gt; tag.</p>
            <h3>Task 2: A Linked Stylesheet</h3>
            <p>	For this task I made a separate CSS stylesheet called mystyle.css which I linked in the linked.html html file. Here I learned the proper way to style a webpage since one stylesheet can be used by every page in the website.</p>
            <h3>Task 3: Class &amp; ID Selectors</h3>
            <p>	In this task I learned about the class and id selectors and how to refer to them in CSS.</p>
            <h3>Task 4: Read, Discover, Experiment, Learn</h3>
            <p>	For this task I followed the same concept as for the HTML task, search, inspect and practice.</p>
            <p>As recommended by the tutors I looked into flexbox, which helped me immensely for my planned nav bar, and I knew about it earlier would have saved me lots of searches and time.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Links</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Preparation</h3>
            <p>	As for the previous week I created a folder and a base HTML file to be used for the rest of this week practical.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: A list of your favourite links</h3>
            <p>	Using the &lt;a&gt; tag I made a list of my favourite links and checked if they worked by viewing the file on a browser.</p>
            <h3>Task 2: Relative links</h3>
            <p>	As stated in the task description I made three different HTML files and linked  them from a index.html file.</p>
            <h3>Task 4: Read, Discover, Experiment, Learn</h3>
            <p>	For this task I followed the same concept as for the HTML and CSS tasks, search, inspect and practice.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Images</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Preparation</h3>
            <p>	The preparation process for this practical was to download from Github a file containing HTML pages which could be navigated to from a browser to see different applications.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: Read, Discover, Experiment, Learn</h3>
            <p>	For this task I followed the same concept as for the HTML, CSS and Links tasks, search, inspect and practice.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Editors</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 1: Making editors work for you</h3>
            <p>Atom shortcuts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>crl-shift-L = syntax highlighting menu to choose from (In case Atom doesn’t auto detect)</li>
              <li>crl-, = settings menu</li>
              <li>crl-shift-P = search menu</li>
              <li>crl-] = indent all selected rows</li>
              <li>crl-Z = undo</li>
              <li>crl-Y = redo</li>
              <li>crl-S = save</li>
              <li>crl-F = search in the file</li>
              <li>crl-/ = comment lines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>	Besides the shortcuts I also experimented with the fonts and themes but continued using the default one, enabled Soft Wrap since it helps to visualize the contents of the webpage. Also experimented with the snippets in order to minimize typing when making the coursework.</p>
            <p>	To help in the typing of my website I installed the atom-html-preview, but stopped using it due to it flickering to much due to the automatic update, so I used a chrome tab for the page preview. Also looked at the rest of the suggested packages and installed a few of them.</p>
            <p>	Due to the suggestion to learn to touch-type and being aware to the increasing amount of typing that I would be doing I started to practice thanks to an online page.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Organising a site:</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 1: Site Architecture</h3>
            <p>	Looking to last’s week practical exercise I saw and understood how difficult it was to organize a site properly so it doesn’t decrement the usability.</p>
            <p>	Taking into account the navigation problems I had during last weeks exercise I started drafting the layout my website would have, since the first draft I’ve changed things, such as having the nav bar always fixed to the top or the mobile view.</p>
          </section>
        <h2>Stick Figure:</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Task 0: Using a browser</h3>
            <p>	After looking at the basic stick-figure code I went through the stick-figure examples to remind myself of what was seen on the lecture, when completed I played the multiplayer game on Jacek’s server. While at Jacek’s server I went though the source code to try and find a way to trick the system and cheat, but at the time wasn’t able to apply any of my ideas, which were: increase my sticks figure speed, making it so a diamond would be created every second in my position, increasing my score without collecting any diamond.</p>
            <h3>Task 1: On your VM</h3>
            <p>	After starting and downloading on my VM the stick-figure code, I installed npm on my VM which is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. Once completed I started the server and played with it and getting instantly banned by changing my speed to 5000, one thing I noticed is that even banned I could make diamonds disappear although once the server receives the client information it makes them appear again.</p>
