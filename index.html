      <h1>Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>As online services become more and more prevalent, users are incited to share personal information in exchange for a better experience using those online services (<a href="#Ref_Galegher_et_al">Galegher, Sproull, &amp; Kiesler, 1998;</a> <a href="#Ref_Metzger">Metzger, 2006;</a> <a href="#Ref_Youn">Youn, 2008;</a> as referenced in <a href="#Ref_Shin_et_al">Shin, &amp; Kang, 2016, p.115</a>).The sharing of information holds a special value in online social networks, due to the connection between online profiles and their real world identities, this disclosure of personal information might be incited by peer pressure, and relaxed attitudes, but sharing personal information on these sites may come at a higher personal cost than one might initially think (<a href="#Ref_Gross_et_al">Gross, &amp; Acquisti , 2005;</a> as referenced in <a href="#Ref_Ge_et_al">Ge, Peng, &amp; Chen, 2014, p.329</a>).</p>

        <h2>Diminished ability to control one's information</h2>
          <p>An emerging threat towards user online exposure comes in the form of losing control over personal information, this can come in the form of marketers collecting information (<a href="#Ref_Nowak_et_al">Nowak, &amp; Phelps, 1995;</a> as referenced in <a href="#Ref_Shin_et_al">Shin et al., 2016, p.115</a>), or other users uploading media containing ourselves that we might not be aware of, in addition, the fact that this information cannot be manually observed due to the sheer amounts of data generated every day online, makes things even worse for an individual user (<a href="#Ref_Smith_et_al">Smith, Szongott, Henne, &amp; Voigt, 2012, p.2</a>). This article also brings up the idea that the perception of damaging data for an individual might change over time (<a href="#Ref_Smith_et_al">Smith et al., 2012, p.2</a>), making us unknowingly leak information that might later become damaging.</p>

          <p>Another aspect users should take more into account, are the information exposure risks associated with signing up for a new service, using a third party service to provide a login mechanism, although convenient, this method of authentication provides the founding blocks for information exposure (<a href="#Ref_Puglisi_et_al">Puglisi, Rebollo-Monedero, &amp; Forne, 2015, p.1051</a>), and data farming by providing the new service access to all of the existing user data from that third party service (<a href="#Ref_Puglisi_et_al">Puglisi et al., 2015, p.1047</a>), in addition, if the new service is like the proximity based application used in this study, this can result in the user being unable to control the flow of location data that that new service is able to gather from the user (<a href="#Ref_Puglisi_et_al">Puglisi et al., 2015, p.1051</a>).</p>

          <p>Along with this resides the fact that neither companies (<a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">Silic, &amp; Back, 2016, p.39</a>) or governmental institutions (<a href="#Ref_Dressler_et_al">Dressler, Bronk, &amp; Wallach, 2015, p.457</a>) have found an effective mechanism to control social networking sites, which makes external users able to access a company's work chat (<a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">Silic et al., 2016, p.39</a>) or gather information of military personnel (<a href="#Ref_Dressler_et_al">Dressler et al., 2015, p.457</a>) with little to no impediment, as demonstrated by <a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">Silic et al.</a> and <a href="#Ref_Dressler_et_al">Dressler et al.</a> in their respective studies.</p>
        <h2>Humans as the weakest link</h2>
          <p>As found in <a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">Silic et al.</a> study, employees were easily deceived by a fake user that claimed to be a company worker, without having to provide documentation, and was able to redirect employees to an external website where the fake user obtained email address, office location, age, name, and function within the company (<a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">2016, p.38</a>), this study shows how easily users are deceived, making us the weakest link in divulging personal information (<a href="#Ref_Dressler_et_al">Dressler et al., 2015, p.457</a>).</p>

          <p>Besides, multiple studies have found a correlation between the youngest demographic, time spent online, and level of online self disclosure (<a href="#Ref_Shin_et_al">Shin et al., 2016, p.119;</a> <a href="#Ref_Öğütçü_et_al">Öğütçü, Testik, &amp; Chouseinoglou, 2016, p.91;</a> <a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">Silic et al., 2016, p.39</a>), suggesting that a high use of the Internet, social networks, and online media, are driving factors in online self disclosure (<a href="#Ref_Öğütçü_et_al">Öğütçü et al., 2016, p.92</a>).</p>
        <h2>Risks associated with online self disclosure</h2>
          <p>All of this different forms of personal information disclosure give way to multiple risks for an individual user, company or state. While a regular user might experience privacy attacks (<a href="#Ref_Puglisi_et_al">Puglisi et al., 2015, p.1047</a>), spamming e-mail, or even cyberbullying (<a href="#Ref_Moscardelli_et_al">Moscardelli, &amp; Divine, 2007;</a> <a href="#Ref_Trepte_et_al">Trepte, &amp; Reinecke, 2011;</a> <a href="#Ref_Youn">Youn, 2008;</a> as referenced in <a href="#Ref_Shin_et_al">Shin et al., 2016, p.115;</a> <a href="#Ref_Ge_et_al">Ge et al., 2014, p.334</a>), a company might be subject to the public scrutiny, since any disclosure of information in online social networks will not only leak personal information, but it will also affect the company’s reputation and how users perceive the company, causing serious financial damage.</p>

          <p>Also, any competitor would be interested on gathering information about other company workers in aspirations of recruiting them and getting a competitive advantage and inside knowledge (<a href="#Ref_Ge_et_al">Ge et al., 2014, p.334</a>), and finally, any leakage of confidential information by a state would result disastrous for any secret operation, as happened in 2012 when the Israeli military revealed the location and time of an upcoming raid in their Facebook page, causing Israeli military to cancel the entire operation (<a href="#Ref_BBC">BBC, 2012</a>).</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Although the number of threats and attacks seems endless, and removing them totally seems unlikely, all authors seem to end their studies agreeing that awareness is the first and most important factor that an individual must learn in order to minimize personal information exposure on the web (<a href="#Ref_Öğütçü_et_al">Öğütçü et al., 2016, p.85;</a> <a href="#Ref_Ge_et_al">Ge et al., 2014, p.335</a>), phishing attacks, and information security threats (<a href="#Ref_Mohammad_et_al">Mohammad, Thabtah, &amp; McCluskey, 2015, p.6</a>). Since it makes users more aware of the risks one may encounter while surfing the web and act in a more protective manner, but neither this or any security measure a user might take will shield a user with complete immunity against personal privacy leakage (<a href="#Ref_Ge_et_al">Ge et al., 2014, p.335</a>).</p>

          <p>Also, the youngest population should be made aware of the risks their online actions have, in order to act appropriately, since most authors view them as the most vulnerable (<a href="#Ref_Öğütçü_et_al">Öğütçü et al., 2016, p.91-92;</a> <a href="#Ref_Silic_et_al">Silic et al., 2016, p.39</a>). Having said this, a new debate arises on whether the responsibility of making the user aware of the privacy risks relies on those services, such as social networking sites to provide the information (<a href="#Ref_Ge_et_al">Ge et al., 2014, p.335</a>), and those who gather user information, or on the user itself.</p>
