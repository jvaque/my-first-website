# my-first-website
This is the first website I made as part of the coursework during first year of university

It consists of a main page containing a Literature Review made as part of the unit coursework, a discovery log of the making of the website and a video that includes subtitles.

The website uses HTML5 and CSS which provides a responsive design, and is made so it will work on all mayor browsers.
